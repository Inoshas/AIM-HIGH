## Autonomous Robot Project
This Git repository houses the code and resources for our innovative project, which focuses on creating an autonomous robot capable of line following, obstacle detection, and obstacle avoidance. The project leverages the power of Lego Mindstorms, Python, and Raspberry Pi to bring this intelligent robot to life. Our goal is to develop a versatile system that can follow lines with precision, detect obstacles in its path, and intelligently navigate around them, all with potential applications in various industries.

The repository contains the source code, documentation, schematics, and additional materials necessary to build, operate, and extend our robot. By collaborating on this platform, we aim to refine and expand our project, exploring new features and use cases. We welcome contributions, feedback, and collaboration from the open-source and robotics communities to drive innovation and advance the field of autonomous robotics.

## Project Overview

The Autonomous Robot Project is an exciting venture that combines robotics, artificial intelligence, and automation. Our aim is to develop an autonomous robot that can perform a range of tasks, including line following, obstacle detection, and obstacle avoidance. This project leverages Lego Mindstorms, Python, and a Raspberry Pi 4 microcomputer, making it a fascinating exploration of robotics and intelligent systems.

## Core Functionality

Our project is built upon three key components, each contributing to the robot's capabilities:

- **Follow Line:** The robot utilizes a color sensor to track and follow lines accurately. This functionality is fundamental for path following and navigation.

- **Detect Obstacle:** With the assistance of a distance sensor, our robot can identify obstacles in its path. This feature ensures safe operation and real-time obstacle detection.

- **Avoid Obstacle:** The robot is equipped with intelligent algorithms that enable it to make decisions on how to avoid encountered obstacles. This includes maneuvering around objects and continuing its path effectively.

## Hardware and Software

- **Lego Mindstorms Set:** We are using the Lego Mindstorms set, model number 51515, as the foundation for our robot's construction. This set provides the essential components for our project.

- **Programming Language:** Our project is primarily coded in Python, which offers a versatile environment for robotics development.

- **Microcomputer:** The brain of our robot is the Raspberry Pi 4 microcomputer, complemented by the Lego BuildHAT for sensor integration.

## Project Phases

1. **Line Following:** In the initial phase, we are focusing on developing the robot's ability to follow lines with precision. This lays the foundation for more complex tasks.

2. **Obstacle Detection:** Following successful line following, we will extend the project to include obstacle detection. The robot will use the distance sensor to identify objects in its path.

3. **Obstacle Avoidance:** The final phase of the project involves the implementation of obstacle avoidance algorithms. The robot will make intelligent decisions to navigate around obstacles and continue its path.

4. **Barcode Reading and Inventory Management:** Future expansions of the project may include the ability to read barcodes and interact with databases, making it suitable for applications in shops and inventory management.
